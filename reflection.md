- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

i liked that inheritance eliminates having to repeat code. i think that it was some new things (ie hashtable) but i liked the assignment and i am looking forward to continuing it next week and seeing where it goes. i am currently in tech week so i wasn't able to go to ta hours this week but i was able to troubleshoot using google quite effectively!
